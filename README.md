<h1>Implementing Active Directory On Premises in Azure</h1>
This tutorial is a step-by-step guide that provides instructions on how to create and configure an on-premises Active Directory (AD) environment within the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used</h2>

- Windows 10 Pro, version 21H2 (free services eligible)
- Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition Gen 2 (free services eligible)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Step 1: You need to authenticate and authorize yourself by logging into the Azure portal.
- Step 2: Setup Resources in Azure
- Step 3: Ensure Connectivity between the client and Domain Controller
- Step 4: Install Active Directory
- Step 5: Create an Admin and Normal User Account in AD
- Step 6: Join Client-1 to your domain (mydomain.com)
- Step 7: Setup Remote Desktop for non-administrative users on Client-1
- Step 8: Create a bunch of additional users and attempt to log into client-1 with one of the users 

<h2>Step 1: You need to authenticate and authorize yourself by logging into the Azure portal</h2>

1. Go to the Azure Portal website (https://portal.azure.com/) and sign-in with your Azure account credentials. 
- Note: If you do not have an Azure account, you will need to sign up for one before you can log-in.
2. Once you have successfully logged-in, you will be redirected to the Azure portal dashboard where you can create and manage your resources. 


<h2>Step 2: Setup Resources in Azure</h2>

1. Click on the search bar and type "Virtual Machines".
2. Click on the "+ Create" button located on the top left-corner by "Switch to classic".
3. Choose the option "Azure virtual machine", enter the following information:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Choose your subscription (For Ex: Azure Subscription 1).</li>
      <li>Create a new name for the resource group (Use: AD-Lab).</li>
      <li>Enter a unique name for the virtual machine (Use: DC-1).</li>
      <li>For "Region" use: (US) West US 3.</li>
      <li>For "Image" use: Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition Gen 2 (free services eligible).</li>
      <li>For "Size" use: Standard_E2s_v3 - 2 vcpus, 16 GiB memory. </li>
      <li>For "Username" use: labuser.</li>
      <li>For "Password" make sure to make up one.</li>
      <li>For "Public inbound ports" click on "Allow selected ports".</li>
      <li>For "Select inbound ports" use: RDP 3389.</li>
    </ol>

- Note: Remember to keep your username and password you created in your notepad, as you will need them later. Also, verify that your information is correct!

4. Click on the "Create" button to create the virtual machine.

- Note: The processing of the VM is expected to take approximately 1-2 minutes. Once the process is complete, we will have successfully deployed the Domain Controller VM, which will act as the dedicated server for our Active Directory.

5. Create another VM. 
      <ol type="a">
      <li>Choose your subscription (For Ex: Azure Subscription 1).</li>
      <li>Create a new name for the resource group (Use: AD-Lab).</li>
      <li>Enter a unique name for the virtual machine (Use: Client-1).</li>
      <li>For "Region" use: (US) West US 3.</li>
      <li>For "Image" use: - Windows 10 Pro, version 21H2 (free services eligible).</li>
      <li>For "Size" use: Standard_E2s_v3 - 2 vcpus, 16 GiB memory. </li>
      <li>For "Username" use: labuser.</li>
      <li>For "Password" make sure to make up one.</li>
      <li>For "Public inbound ports" click on "Allow selected ports".</li>
      <li>For "Select inbound ports" use: RDP 3389.</li>
    </ol>

4. Click on the "Create" button to create the virtual machine.
